# MS2

If you want to see the result - open file ms2.pdf. Other files are auxiliary and provided by Latex.

I want to add some explanations to everyone who would use my code. As you see every TEX file is named "ms2.extension". The reason is that my folder is named "ms2".

Also here images presented. They were drawn in R. R-file also will be added with explanations.
